This repository contains an example of an integer overflow bug in C and its solution. Integer overflow occurs when an arithmetic operation produces a result that is outside the range of values that can be represented by the data type. This can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes. The solution involves using a data type that can accommodate larger values, such as long long int or unsigned int, based on the context of the program and the expected range of values.
